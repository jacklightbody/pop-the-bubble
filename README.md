# The Other Side
The Other Side is a way to escape echo chambers by encouraging knowledge on both sides of issues. When users read a number of articles on a given topic that share similar viewpoints, they are prompted to read a few articles with contrasting views so that they can truly understand both sides of an issue.

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jacklightbody/the-other-side/releases) and follow the instructions for your browser.

### Chrome
Open the [chrome extension page](chrome://extensions) and drag and drop the chrome.crx file onto the page. When a popup to "Add The Other Side" appears, select add extension. 

## Usage
After installation, a browser icon should appear on the toolbar that looks like a scale. If you read an article that has a positive viewpoint of an issue then the scale will tip to the left, while negative articles will tip the scale to the right. If the scale starts tipping too far in one direction, you can read an opposite article to balanace it back out again. To get an idea of what to look for, you can simply click on the scale icon and a popup will appear suggesting searches to further your understanding of both sides of an issue.
